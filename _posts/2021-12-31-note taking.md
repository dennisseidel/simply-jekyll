I take notes as markdown in Obsidian. I use [outliner](https://github.com/vslinko/obsidian-outliner) and simple headline to structure the text. I use a meeting template: [[meeting_tempate]][^1].

I prepare my meetings notes up front so I know what to say. Following my [[meetings best practices]] is share my proposal up front & afterwards. I take also live notes during the meeting.

	* stop going to class - if you fall behind, i can't catch up / to much distractions 
		* better "recorded" lectures 
	* struggle first, watch later 
	* don't take notes -> only flash cards ([Skim, Question, Rephrase, Recall, Repetition](https://youtu.be/JNJJEFzaOiA?t=289)) 
		* skim and write down all the bolded terms
